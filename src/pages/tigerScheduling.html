                    Tiger Scheduling is a basic scheduling app developed
                    as a means to help me better keep track of my day
                    to day tasks. Having used Apple's reminder app for
                    the longest time, I wanted to create an app that 
                    simplifies the whole process and also learn
                    how to develop iOS applications.

                    While simple, this app will have a huge impact on 
                    your day-to-day life. Everyone forgets something, 
                    whether it be an item on a grocery list or forgetting
                    the time when you need to leave, or even forgetting
                    to remind yourself to do the simplest of things. You can 
                    use this app to remind yourself of pretty much anything
                    without the hassle of having to navigate a complex UI.

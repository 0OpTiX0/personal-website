                    Tiger Schduling is a basic scheduling app developed
                    as a means to help me better keep track of my day
                    to day tasks. Having used Apple's reminder app, for
                    the longest of time, I wanted to create an app that 
                    simplified the whole process and as well as learn
                    how to develop iOS Applications.

                    While simple, this app will have a huge impact on 
                    your day-to-day life. Everyone forgets something, 
                    wether it be an item on a grocery list, or a forgetting
                    the time of when you need to leave, or even forgetting
                    to remind yourself to do the simplest of things. You can 
                    use this app to remind yourself of pretty much anything
                    without the hassle of having to navigate a complex UI.
                    to do so.

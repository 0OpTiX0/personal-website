            <img src="images/joseph.png">

            <p>I am an undergraduate student at Clemson University, 
                majoring in Computer Science. My interests include 
                iOS app development, software engineering and machine learning.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My goal, both in life and in my career, is to make a positive impact 
                through my work. I strive to develop technologies that improve the quality 
                of life, making things easier for others while promoting intellectual 
                growth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of academics, I am an avid gamer who loves playing sci-fi,
                action, and adventure games with friends. I also enjoy fishing, sports 
                (Go Mets!), and spending quality time with my family.
            </p>

            <p> I am excited to work with you on your next project. </p>

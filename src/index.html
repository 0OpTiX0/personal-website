            <p>I am an undergraduate student at Clemson University, majoring in Computer Science. My interests include app development, data science, and machine learning.</p>
            
            <p>My goal, both in life and in my career, is to make a positive impact through my work. I strive to develop technologies that improve quality of life, making things easier for others while promoting intellectual growth.</p>
            <p> Outside of academics, I am an avid gamer who loves playing sci-fi, action, and adventure games with friends. I also enjoy fishing, sports (Go Mets!), and spending quality time with my family. </p>
            <p> I am excited to work with you in your next project. </p>
